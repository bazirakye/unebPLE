The minister of health has built health centers in our communities. They are basically put in place to provide health services to the people. They provide medical care and counseling services. They have doctors and nurses to handle patients.\n

In all health centres, people are advised and encouraged to eat food that do not have harmful substances. They provide drugs to patients and pregnant mothers. AIDS victims are given free treatment by the government through the health workers.\n

To be free from some diseases, people should avoid disease vectors like rats, mosquitoes, fleas and others. These disease vectors spread malaria, cholera, typhoid and dysentery. In order to control the diseases, many measures should be taken into consideration. Such measures include; slashing the bushes around homelands, using clean water, washing our bodies, spraying with insecticides and removing stagnant water around homesteads.\n

My name is Nakato and I am a primary seven candidate in Piri Boarding Primary School. I have a short story to share with fellow candidates.\n
Last year, during the second term holiday, my mother sent me to the market. She wanted me to buy a pumpkin. I asked Bruno, my half brother, to come along with me. A short distance away from home, we met an old man. He was carrying bag made out of dry palm leaves. He looked a very poor old man from a village. He smiled and greeted us. Bruno answered but I kept quiet. I did not like the way he was dressed. He then asked us to direct him to the house of a lawyer, Mr. Mutebi. I never wanted Bruno to direct him to our home but he did. This hurt me so much that I felt like fighting Bruno. He told me that it was bad manners to treat strangers like that.\n
Immediately we got back home, my mother welcomed us. She was very happy to have a visitor. The visitor was the old man we had met on the way. She asked us to greet him. Bruno went immediately and shook his hand. I pretended that I was taking the pumpkin to the kitchen. My mother was very angry with me. She asked if that was the kind of respect I showed to elders. She continued to shout at me saying that the old man was my grandfather. “calm down my daughter, Nakato has heard”, said the old man. He then picked a watch from the old bag and handed it to my half brother. “Bruno, may God bless you my grandson”, he said.\n
Oh My God! I missed a very beautiful watch. I was ashamed before my mother and grandfather too. Fellow candidates, I advise you to always respect elders. It is also important to help and direct strangers. Always respect, love and care for everyone.\n

<b><i>  Read the passage below and then answer in full sentences the questions that follow.</i></b>
               Zawadi was broken up by the loud crowing of a cock in the neighborhood. She sat on her bed and this time, forgot to pray, like she used to do. She jumped out of her bed only to realize that everybody was still asleep. She tip-toed to her parents’ bedroom. Just at the door way, she heard some snoring. This confirmed her expectation. “Now is the chance to let everybody know that I can wake up before them,” she said to herself happily.\n
                   In a few minutes she was already dressed and set for school. Opening the door quietly, she got out. She started her journey to school. She was surprised walking for some distance without meeting anybody. This didn’t scare her. She continued with her journey until she met a man. The man looked unkind but proved to be kind when he asked to give her a lift on his bicycle. Zawadi accepted and thanked him.\n
               The man rode very fast and even faster towards the school. She told the man that he had passed the school but he pretended not to have heard. The louder she shouted, the faster he rode. Zawadi realized that she was in danger. She immediately prayed to God and contained her tears. When they reached a trading center and saw some people, she shouted for help. “This man is kidnapping me! kidnapping me! kidnapping me! “ she shouted. People at the trading center started running after them. Those who had bicycles rode faster after him. Finally, they caught up with him. The man realizing danger abandoned the bicycle and fled for his life.\n
               The strong men ran after him while women remained with Zawadi listening to her story. Luckily enough, the man was caught and brought back to the trading center. He was handed over to police. The man was taken to court and charged. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for attempted kidnap.\n

<b><i>51. Read the passage below and then answer in full sentences the questions that follow.</i></b>\n
Waya primary school is a day school in the middle of Seseme village. In this school, lunch is given only to those pupils whose parents have paid lunch money.\n
One day, four boys and three girls studying in this school started their journey home. It was after the afternoon classes. None of their parents had paid the lunch money. These children were hungry and weak. On their way, they saw a mango tree with some ripe fruits on it.\n
‘’I am hungry. Why don’t we visit that mango tree for fruits?’’ Bruno, one of the boys asked. ‘’yaah’’, his friend Robert shouted excitedly. The rest including the girls supported the idea.\n
All the seven of them approached the tree. They saw the ripe fruits. They started to throw some stones at them. One of the girls, Kawudha said, ‘’I see a bee-hive on that big branch’’. ‘’we shall not climb but just throw stones. Make sure you don’t disturb the bees’’, Robert said.\n
They started throwing stones at the ripe mangoes. Some mangoes fell on the ground. Unfortunately, quite a number of mangoes fell on the bee-hive. The boys and girls started collecting mangoes which had fallen on the ground. Suddenly, a swarm of bees rushed out of the beehive. The bees attacked all of them. Each one of them was running towards the road. The bees followed them and stung everyone. They threw away all the ripe mangoes they had picked.\n
‘’Fall down and cover yourselves with grass!’’ shouted Mathew. All of them did so. After a few minutes the bees went back to their beehive. The girls remained on the ground crying. The boys called the girls as they were removing the grass from their bodies. They continued their journey home. Their mouths, hands, eyes, noses, ears and other parts of their bodies were swollen.\n
When they reached home, their parents saw the way each one of them looked. They were sorry for their children. One of the boys told the parents that they were very hungry since they did not get lunch at school.\n
The parents were concerned and after treating their children they went with them to school and they talked to the head teacher.\n\n

One Saturday, I went with my mother to Biraga market which is one of the biggest in our sub-county. I had a duck which uncle Opaya gave me when it was a duckling. I went to sell it so as to buy myself a pair of shoes for Christmas. Mother took a goat for sale so as to purchase various items for the big occasion.\n
\n
On our way, we met farmers and traders bringing different items to the market. By ten O\'clock, we had reached the market.\n
\n
At the market entrance, there was a rope stretching from one side to the other. This blocked people from entering the market directly. Mother had to pay some coins to the gentleman who later allowed us in. many other people were already at the market with different commodities heaped on the ground and others were in the stalls. Some traders sang songs to attract as many customers as possible. I stood still listening and enjoying the interesting songs.\n
\n
We sat down in the tree shade and waited anxiously for customers. Some customers tried to bargain but mother did not want to sell her goat for anything less than what she wanted. Later a young man bargained and offered her fifty thousand shillings which she accepted.\n
\n
Sometime later, I sold my duck for fifteen thousand shillings only. We then moved through the crowd. Mother held me by the arm and we went to the place where the shoes were being sold. She helped me to make a choice. I was very happy to get my first pair of shoes in life. I then paid ten thousand shillings leaving me with a balance of five thousand.\n
\n
Mother used some of her money to buy meat, plates, sugar, salt and tomatoes. She kept the remaining amount in her handbag. We then moved happily back home\n

(a) On which day of the week does Biraga market take place?\n

(b) Where did the writer get the duckling from?\n

As they dig out my feet,\n
Peel, cut and boil them.\n

With fried feet the young chatas they eat,\n
Chips, chips, chips,\n
Delicious cassava chips!\n

One morning, Nante could not find her skin sandals. This typ of sandals are worn by cattle herders to guard their feet against thorns and sharp stones. She therefore went barefoot to the grazing area.\n
\n
Nante is a person who enjoys her job, but on this particular day, it was different. Her feet were badly pricked by thorns. Worse still, they were hurt by sharp stones too. As a result, she could not move any more so she sat under a tree to rest and fell asleep.\n
\n
The cattle were grazing near a maize garden. They invaded this garden and destroyed part of the crop.\n
At this time, the owner of the garden noticed the animals. He rushed to the scene but it was too late to save part of his crop. He was too shocked to say a word! He angrily chased the animals out of the garden.\n
\n
Nante was immediately awoken by the footsteps of the running cattle. She then asked him where he was taking the animals. With a word, the angry man hit her with a stick and she collapsed. so these are your cattle?, he asked. "Look at my garden!"\n
\n
Nante realized her mistake and painfully said, "excuse me sir, I am sorry". Look at my feet full of thorns. They are so painful that am unable to run after the animals. My sandals got lost at home. Please forgive me."\n

Long ago, there was a hunter who used to catch animals using a trap. One day, he set a trap in one of the thick bushes near his home. After some hours, he went to check his trap. He was sure that he would find at least an animal in it. As he walked nearer the trap, he saw a snake in it. The man was shocked.\n
\n
"So it is you inside my trap!" the man said.\n
"Please le me out!" the snake cried.\n
"I\'ve got you this time!" said the man as he started looking for a big stick.\n
"Please, don\'t kill me! If you let me out, we shall be good friends" said the snake.\n
"If I let you out of the trap, will you promise that you won\'t bite me?" asked the man\n.
"I promise! I promise that I won\'t bite you. You will be very safe if you let me out of this dangerous trap" replied the snake.\n
"Alright, I\'ll let you out." Said the man. So, the man set the snake free.\n
"Aha! I\'m now free. I'm now going to bite you because you were the one who set the trap" said the snake.\n
Just as the snake was about to jump on the man, Mr. Rat arrived at the place.\n
"What\'s the matter?" Mr. Rat asked.\n
"I had set my trap to catch animals. But this unfriendly snake got caught in it. He begged me to let him out and he promised not to bite me if I set him free. After letting him out, he changed his mind. He was just about to bite me when you arrived," the man explained to Mr.Rat\n
\n
"I see! I see!", said Mr.Rat as he was now thinking of what should be done.\n
"Let\'s do this. Could you set the trap again and let me see exactly how snake got caught in it?" Mr. Rat asked the man.\n
\n
"Yes. I\'ll do that." Replied the man as he set the trap again.\n
"Now, my friend Mr.Snake get in and let\'s see how you got caught in this trap." Mr. Rat said politely. The snake agreed and entered the trap. Once more he was unable to escape.\n
"There you are," Mr. Rat told the man.\n
"Now you can go ahead and kill him so tha" we are all safe. Mr Rat added.\n

P.O.BUNDIBUGYO\n
2nd November, 2005\n
Dear Patel,\n
Thank you for your letter which was full of news. It is quite interesting to note that India too has a Universal Primary Education system.\n
In your letter you wanted answers to a number of questions concerning our Universal Primary Education (UPE) in short. First, you asked about the number of children that have benefited from UPE system. Well, the number of primary school-going children has increased suddenly from around two million in 1997 to about seven million in 2005. My country shall soon boast of a literate population.\n
Secondly, you wanted to know the attitude of my people towards the girl - child. You know, before UPE was introduced, most Ugandans believed that girls were expected to do nothing else but to remain at home to do all types of work. Funny enough, even girls and women had this same view about themselves. The girls could be married - off at quite an early age. Imagine, a girl of thirteen years of age being proposed for marriage!\n
Well, my dear Patel, things are now different. The girls are reading hard and many of them have reached high levels of education and have been appointed to top jobs in the country. We for example, have over a dozen women holding high posts in government. These women in my country.\n
It is my hope that I have answered your questions. Please let me know in your next letter something about your secondary education system. Once more, thank you for writing. Please extend my best greetings to your family.\n
Yours sincerely,\n
Peter Kambala\n\n

There are a number of things parents must remember if they want their children to rest <u>properly</u> during the holidays. The first one child during holidays.

The second thing to remember is that the children should do a lot of play while they are at home for holidays. They can also help their parents with some work.\n

        One Monday morning, Obibi was <u>miserable</u>. This was because it was the beginning of the usual week-long suffering at school. Obibi was in primary Two. In order not to miss staying at home to play with other village children, he developed a plan. He picked his school bag and pretended to go to school. The school was two kilometers from his home.\n
After moving alone along a bushy path to school, he branched immediately to a nearby bush and hid himself under spear grass. This was around 8:00a.m.\n
As he was busy preparing his resting place, some hunters approached the bush where he was hiding. Obibi did not know that the roasted cassava he had attracted the dogs. The dogs started running towards his hiding bush at a great speed and the hunters followed hurriedly. They thought the dogs had got the smell of a wild animal.\n
Obibi foolishly kept on shaking the grass. One hunter then aimed his spear at the shaking bush. Obibi was only saved when one dog jumped to his hiding place. He then made a very loud surprising noise which made the hunters and the dogs to run to different directions. They thought it was a ghost, the god of the forest.\n
        The hunters and the dogs then took off in fear of their lives. Obibi ran up to home to report to his parents how he escaped death. Instead of punishing Obibi the parents thanked God for saving his life and warned him never to <u>dodge</u> going to school again.\n\n

        <b><i>51. Read the following passage carefully and answer, in full sentences, the questions that follow.</i></b>\n
There are more species of insects than all animals added altogether. The study of insects is called entomology. It is extremely important that we learn about insects since some of them do some damage to man, his animals, crops, stores of food and materials.\n
Despite the terrible damage and diseases caused by some insects, there are benefits that man generally gets from insects. Insects play an important part in the pollination of crops. Some insects also produce commercially important products; bees produce honey and wax; the silk worms produce the silk threads that are used in the manufacture of expensive fabrics.\n
        Insects are grouped under Arthropods and have common characteristics such as exoskeleton, joined legs and <u>segmented</u> bodies. Their bodies are divided into three <u>distinct</u> parts, that is, head, thorax and the abdomen. The head, the first part of the body, comprises of the feelers and the compound eyes.\n
The second part of the body is the thorax and this consists of three segments which bear three pairs of legs. The insect with its three pairs of legs can easily be differentiated from spiders which have four pairs.\n
The abdomen is the third part of the body. The segments of the abdomen have no legs but contain various organs of the reproductive system. In some insects there are some structures at the back end of the abdomen which have various functions, for example, egg-laying, as seen at the back-end of bush, crickets or for causing a painful sting, as seen at the back-end of wasps.\n
a) What do you call the study of insects?\n
b) How are insects harmful to man?\n
c) What is the most important role played by insects to man?\n
d) Which insect has a painful sting?\n
e) Which part of an insect contains various organs of the reproductive system?\n
f) Which type of skeleton system do arthropods possess?\n

(i) Distinct\n
(ii) Segment\n\n

The <u>abolition</u> of corporal punishment in schools by the Ministry of Education and Sports disappointed our teachers of Timol Primary School. Corporal punishment was the only way they used to punish pupils. Every teacher used to carry a cane all the time, pupils were very miserable and quite a number of them left school because of caning.\n
The most hated teachers was Mr. Tori , the Deputy Headmaster. He was secretly nicknamed Mr. Talons by pupils because he was fond of squeezing and pulling their ears, which would make them <u>tip-toe</u> in great pain. One day, Mr. Tori asked my young sister to say his name. When the girl said that his name was Tori, her ears were squeezed until they bled, for failing to say Mr. Tori. The frightened girl never returned to school again. She only came back after the abolition of corporal punishment in schools.\n
There was group punishment for all the pupils if they failed to point out the wrong doers. They would be punished for talking or laughing in the classroom or laughing in the classroom or during assembly, removing a piece a piece of chalk from the teachers\' desk or drawing a funny picture on the chalkboard.\n
Individual punishment was given to a pupil for late coming or poor performance in class.\n
I thank the ministry responsible for education for what it has done. The canes have disappeared from our school and the Deputy Headmaster is no longer called Mr. Talons but Mr. Tori.\n\n

<b><i>3. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow in full sentences.</i></b>
According to a Greek story teller, a boy called Magnets was a shepherd who used to look after his father\'s flock. He carried a spear which he used as a support when he was climbing up steep hills. He also used it for driving the sheep in the direction he wanted them to go.\n
        One day, as he stood watching his flock, he rested the tip of his spear on a piece of rock. But when he tried to lift the spear again, he found to his great surprise that the iron tip of the spear had got stuck on the rock. He managed to pull the spear, but he realized that from the rock there was a <u>mysterious</u> force which attracted iron objects. As time went on other people also found pieces of this type of rock which attracted iron objects. But because Magnets was the first to discover the powerful rock, such pieces of rock were called magnets.\n
Another second Greek story was that magnets got their name from a Greek district called Magnesia where piece of the rock which attracted iron were supposed to have been first discovered.\n
The third story is that of the Chinese. The Chinese said that a great king Hoangti not only discovered magnetic rock but also invented the first magnetic compass. Although this is a <u>Legend</u>, we do know that thousand s of years ago Chinese travelers made use of magnetized needles as compasses in order to find their way through the vast Chinese Empire.\n
It was recently, only 600 years ago, that men in Europe made effective use of the magnetic needle compass for their sea voyages. This led to the discovery of America by Columbus. The Dutch, Portuguese and English made voyages to Africa, India, Indonesia and Australia. Indeed, this simple magnetic needle proved to be very useful in discovering parts of the world.\n\n
